                <li>In case of alliances, lesser parties may pay tribute to more powerful parties as a sign of allegiance and often in order to 
                    finance projects that would benefit both parties</li>
                <li>The ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire is an example of an ancient tribute empire; one that made relatively few demands on its
                     non-Persian subjects other than the regular payment of tribute, which might be gold, luxury goods, animals, soldiers or slaves.</li>
                <li>The medieval Mongol rulers of Russia also expected only tribute from the Russian states, which continued to govern themselves</li>
                <li>The reliefs at Persepolis show processions of figures bearing varied types of tribute</li>
